# Passively Stabilized Weather Balloon
A weather balloon designed to gather stable footage and photographs in the upper atmosphere

The design uses a pendulum attached to a 3-axis gimbal in order to keep the pitch and roll axis stable, and the yaw axis is stabilized via a wind vane at the bottom. The vane also acts as a ballast, functioning as stabilization for all 3 axis. Previous versions tried to use either a stepper motor controlled gimbal or a set of reaction wheels to perform this, but the passive option was deemed the simplest to design and build. The previous versions are still in the repository somewhere, but lack documentation. While I have not built this yet, preliminary tests of just the 3D printed components have proven to be successful, but real world results are needed to conclude if this design is worth the while.

## FAQ

### Is this still in development?
If by development, you mean completely abandoned, then yes! For realsies, much like many of the other projects that I do, I'll probably continue it one day if I find the desire to do so, but who knows how long that'll be. 

### Does that mean I can use these files?
Yea sure go ham
 <sub>(a little credit wouldn't hurt tho)</sub>

### Is this safe?
Well it doesn't have a parachute right now so I would assume the answer is no

### Who will be mad if I build this?
The FAA and potentially whoever's backyard this ends up in. The former can be solved by hitting up your local air traffic control tower and telling them the detes about your stratospheric endeavors and the latter can be solved by adding a little note telling them how to return it.

### There's no way to mount the GoPro! This design is completely unfinished!
